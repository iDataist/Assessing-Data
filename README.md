# Assessing-Data

Assess data visually and programmatically using pandas. 

Distinguish between dirty data (content or “quality” issues) and messy data (structural or “tidiness” issues). 

Identify data quality issues and categorize them using metrics: validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity.
